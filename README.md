## Library

Your job is to create a JavaScript class named `Library` in `main.js` that models a library.

- The library class manages a collection of users and books being checked out and returned.
- You can add books and users to the library. It can also be constructed with initial collections of books and users.
- Users can checkout books in the library.
- Users can return books that they have checked out.

There is a test suite to guide you and help you check yourself. To run the test suite, just view `index.html` in your browser. I suggest using live server so that your tests rerun when you save you file.

**Important:** Each of the rubric points is checked by a test case. The test cases specify the name of the required methods, arguments, etc. So **read each test case carefully.**
